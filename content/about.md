Self taught programmer — trained designer.

Art school taught me how to take criticism & build off feedback. Entrepreneurship taught to be self-reliant at solving problems and implementing solutions.

Forever addicted to learning — especially new/better ways of doing things.

My most consistent & valued skill throughout 10+ years in web development has been proficient google searching.
