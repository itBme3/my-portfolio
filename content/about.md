Self taught programmer — trained designer.

Art school taught me how to take criticism and building off feedback. Entrepreneurship taught to be self-reliant at solving problems and implementing solutions.

My most consistent and valued skill during 10+ years in web development has been proficient google searching. There have been few (if any) problems I have not been able to find/build solutions for — while staying on-budget.

Forever addicted to learning — especially new/better ways of doing things.
