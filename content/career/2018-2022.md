Worked intimately with small/mid-sized companies to create web-based solutions that increased bottom line. 
Our most consistent client saw 10x lift in online revenue per month, and maintains a conversion rate that is more than 3x better than industry average (avg: 1.4% client: 4.5%).

<small>What I did:</small>
- Frontend web development for ecommerce & marketing sites
- Developed apps (used internally) to better connect various 3rd-party APIs & improve productivity
- UI/UX design
- Collaboration with clients and their teams to develop solutions for improving & automating web-based marketing
